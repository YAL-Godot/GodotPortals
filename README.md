This is my entry for ["Stop Waiting For Godot"](https://itch.io/jam/stop-waiting-for-godot) jam!

I wanted to mess around with portals/non-Euclidean mechanics, and so I did, and you get this little first-person platformer.

It is not as technical as I originally intended, but still I learnt a lot about what you can and what you cannot do with Godot.
